<h1><a name="#installation">Installation</a></h1>
<p>Starting with version 1.1, frhed uses the self extracting <a href="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis/">Nullsoft "SuperPIMP" Install System</a>,
which is a setup program familiar to anyone who has ever run Winamp.</p>

<p>frhed supports normal Windows uninstall behaviour as found in the Control Panel.</p>

</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#what-are-binary-files">What are binary files?</a></h2>
<p>All the files on your computer, programs as well as documents, are really large "lists" of
numbers. Imagine a numbered list like this one:</p>

<p>0) 24<br>
1) 33<br>
2) 9<br>
3) 0<br>
4) 115</p>

<p>The numbering starts at zero. At each list index there is a number, for example the number
9 is at index "2". The index is usually called "offset". frhed displays the current offset in
the lower left corner of it's window. Large files contain many numbers, small files not so
many. The numbers in the list can have a value between 0 and 255, for a special reason:
Each number is a "byte".</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#what-are-bits-n-bytes">What are bits and bytes?</a></h2>
<p>"Bit" is an abbreviation for "BInary digiT". It can have a value of either 0 or 1. One bit
alone is not very useful, because already the number 2 can not be described with it. So you
take many bits to describe large numbers. This is how it works:<br>
The normal decimal system you know, with digits from 0 to 9, describes numbers larger than
9 by arranging several digits in such a way that each position in the number means something different.</p>

<p>For example the number "245" means really "2 times 100 + 4 times 10 + 5 times 1". The further left a
digit's position in the number, the higher a value it contributes to the number. Every time you go one
step left in the number, you multiply the digit there with 1, 10, 100, 1000 and so on and add that value
to what you already have. The values you have to multiply the digit <b>with</b> can be obtained if you start
out with 1 on the far right, then multiply with 10 every time you go left. So you get to multiply with
1, then with 1&times;10=10, then with 10&times;10=100, then 10&times;100=1000 and so on. This is our "base 10" number system.</p>

<p>Now the <b>binary system</b> is a "base 2"-system. A binary number might looks like this: 1011</p>

<p>This is not "one thousand and eleven", as it would be in the decimal system. In the decimal system
we multiplied the digits at the various positions with a 1, 10, 10&times;10=100, 10&times;100=1000 and so on,
but this time, in the binary system (also known as "dual system"), we multiply with 1, 2, 2&times;2=4,
2&times;4=8, 2&times;8=16 and so on, starting at the right and doing with a "2" what we did with a "10"
before. So the value of the binary number above is "1 times 1 + 1 times 2 + 0 times 4 + 1 times 8",
giving us the number "11" in our decimal system.</p>

<p>Computers use bits to calculate everything, because they can be modeled as "current on" or
"current off" easily. With a packet of 4 bits (called a "nibble") you can describe the numbers
from 0 to 15. A packet of 8 bits is called a "byte", and <b>these</b> are what the file contains.
Each byte can describe a number from 0 to 255.
So, a file is a list (or "array") of "bytes", with each byte at a certain index or "offset".
These bytes are what frhed displays in the middle of the screen, but in yet another different
number system: the "hexadecimal" system, which is a system with the base 16. So there are 16
digits, the normal ones from 0 to 9, and additionally the letters "a" through "f" with following
values:</p>

<p>a = 10<br>
b = 11<br>
c = 12<br>
d = 13<br>
e = 14<br>
f = 15</p>

<p>So the "hex" (short for "hexadecimal") number "f14a" means: "10 times 1 + 4 times 16 + 1 time
16&times;16(=256) + 15 times 16&times;256(=4096)", giving a value of 61770 in decimal. The point of using
hex numbers is that values of up to 255 (maximum value of a byte) can be described by employing
up to 2 hexadecimal digits, which gives a neat and ordered output on hex editors such as frhed.
On the right side of the frhed window there are "normal" letters, punctuation symbols and so on.
This is because each byte can be seen as an index to a symbol in a "character set". This means
that the computer stores for example the letter "a" as a number with the value 97 ("61" in hex
notation), the comma "," as a number 44 and so on. So if you write a text on the computer and
save it to disk, then the file will contain a number of bytes, each byte signifying a letter,
other symbol, or a special code number for "End of line" or "Tabulator" and such. But there are
several character sets in use (for example Windows uses either the ANSI or the OEM character set):
In one character set the number 97 might mean the letter "a", but in another it could be used for
the apostrophe.</p>

<h1><a name="#file-operations">File operations</a></h1>
<p>The following File Operations are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#file-new">Creating new files</a></li>
<li><a href="#file-open">Opening files</a></li>
<li><a href="#file-open-partially">Opening files partially</a></li>
<li><a href="#saving-files">Saving files</a></li>
<li><a href="#save-selection-as">Saving selections</a></li>
<li><a href="#revert-file">Reverting to the saved file</a></li>

<li><a href="#export-as-hexdump">Exporting the file as a hexdump text</a></li>
<li><a href="#import-hexdump">Importing a hexdump file</a></li>
</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#file-new">Creating new files</a></h2>
<p>If frhed is started without parameters or with a nonexistant filename as parameter,
then it starts with a new, empty file that is untitled. If a file is already loaded, then
choose <dfn>File/New</dfn> from the menu. If a file is already loaded and it has been changed, then
you will be prompted if you want to save the changes.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#file-open">Opening files</a></h2>
<p>If frhed is started with command line parameters, then the whole string following the
program name is considered to be the name of the file to open.</p>

<p><b>Examples</b>:</p>

<p>
<code>frhed filename.dat</code> opens the file called "filename.dat"<br>
<code>frhed a file-name.dat</code> opens the file called "a file-name.dat"
</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: If you put a link to frhed.exe into the "SendTo"-Folder in your Windows main
directory then you can open any file from the Explorer with frhed by choosing frhed
from the "Send To"-item in the file's context menu.</p>

<p>You can also choose <dfn>File/Open</dfn> from the menu. If a file is already loaded and it has
been changed, then you will be prompted if you want to lose the changes, save the changes
or cancel the request.</p>

<p>A file can also be dragged (for instance from the Windows Explorer window) into frhed's
window to open it. If several files were dragged, then you must choose which one to open.</p>

<p>You may also select a file from the MRU list to open.</p>

<p>If the file access permissions don't allow writing or open-read-only mode is on then
read-only mode will be engaged.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#file-open-partially">Opening files partially</a></h2>
<p>If you want to edit a very large file and it's not necessary to load all of it into memory,
choose the <dfn>File/Open partially</dfn> command. First you will have to choose the file you want to open in a
File-Open-dialog. Then you must enter the offset from which the file will be loaded
and how many bytes to load, or you can check the "Open partially from end of file"-radiobutton
if you want to load data from the end of the file. Also you may have frhed display the offsets
relative to the start of the file instead of relative to the start of the loaded block. Note,
however, that so far the rest of the program uses offsets relative to start of the loaded block.
</p>

<p>frhed will now be in partially-opened-mode, which means that whenever you choose the <dfn>File/Save</dfn> command,
the data will be written back to the position they were loaded from. This mode is indicated by
a letter "P" in the window title after the file name.</p>

<p>If the file has been changed, then you will be prompted if you want to lose the changes,
save the changes or cancel the request.</p>

<p>You can also resize the block of data you loaded and the corresponding section of the file
will also be resized when you save the file.</p>

<p>If the file access permissions don't allow writing or open-read-only mode is on then read-only
mode will be engaged.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#saving-files">Saving files</a></h2>
<p>To save the current file choose <dfn>File/Save</dfn> from the menu.
If the file has never been saved before, then <dfn>File/Save as</dfn>
will be automatically invoked.</p>

<p><dfn>File/Save as</dfn> saves the file with a different name.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#save-selection-as">Saving selections</a></h2>
<p>To save the current selection choose <dfn>File/Save selection as</dfn> from the menu.
If the is no selection then all of the file will be saved.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#revert-file">Reverting to the saved file</a></h2>
<p>When you have made changes to a file, want to change it back and cannot remember the exact
bytes in the file then the <dfn>File/Revert</dfn> command will do it for you. If the file has never been saved
then this command will revert to an untitled empty file.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#export-as-hexdump">Exporting the file as a hexdump text</a></h2>

<p>The <dfn>File/Export as hexdump</dfn> command is used if you need the hexdump of the file in
plain text form, for example if
you need to insert it in a word processor document. You can either put the hexdump into the
clipboard or into a file, which you will have to choose. The start line of the hexdump has to
be specified (in hexadecimal notation without prefix), which you can find on the left side of
the window, for example 23c or 134. You must also specify the end line. The values in the
dialog will be initialized so that the whole file will be dumped, if there is nothing
selected, or they will be such that the current selection will be dumped.</p>

<p>Also you have the option of just outputting the hex bytes on a single line
- just uncheck the "Export like frhed display" check box.</p>

<p>Also you have the option of outputting an RTF hexdump of the lines. The RTF is output
by frhed as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The file that was hexdumped in the document properties as the Title.</li>
<li>A Times New Roman 20pt paragraph containing the file name of the file that was hexdumped.</li>
<li>Each line of hexdump, with the selection or current byte highlighted as per the display colours.</li>
<li>Bookmarks are both highlighted and put into the document. The bookmark name is that same as
what you gave frhed, unless you didn't give a name, in which case the name will be the offset of the
bookmark in decimal. The document bookmarks will be in the same place as the caret.</li>
<li>The separators are put in a single group together and are simple lines as per the display settings.</li>
<li>Limitations: the RTF output is not perfect in these ways:<br>
For the chars Microsoft Word will convert some into underscores (generally the control characters up to 0x20).
This is only apparent in OEM mode since in ANSI mode frhed translates these chars into periods (.).<br>
Microsoft Word will alter the bookmark names by replacing non-alphanumerics
with underscores, place "BM" in front of bookmarks that begin with a number and hide bookmarks
beginning with underscores (can still view them with "Hidden bookmarks" checked).<br>
If your display is running at anything less than 24 bit colour you may not get the colours you expect for the
caret. This is because at lower bit levels the InvertRect function (which frhed uses to invert the caret in the window)
works differently than just inverting the bits of colours as it does at 24-bit &amp; as frhed does in
generating the inverted colour for RTF export. If someone finds out how InvertRect works at lower bit
levels please let me (Pabs) know.<br>
The bookmarks border takes up space (at least on Word2000) which means that subsequent characters on the same line
will be displaced to the right 2 pixels. This is noticable when there is a selection covering two adjacent lines,
one with &amp; one without a bookmark. There is little that can be done about this except try a different word processor.<br>
The separators will not always be sized or positioned exactly. There is not much that can be done about this since
it is hard to know the exact size in twips the word processor will display the text at. An alternative to this might
be to use tables, which might not work and might also solve the bookmark problem.<br>
At some fonts &amp; sizes (esp. OEM &amp; ANSI 9, ANSI 10) frhed cannot determine the correct font name the
system chose &amp; this will cause Word to use the wrong font, often this will be Times New Roman. This may or may not
be true depending on whether or not the font mapper for your system uses one font for all sizes and the fonts you have installed.
Unfortunately Word ignores the other font hints that can be determined; character set, variable/monospaced and font family.</li>
</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#delete-file">Deleting the current file</a></h2>

<p><u><font color="red" size="+3"><b>USE WITH CAUTION</b></font></u></p>

<p>The <dfn>File/Delete File</dfn> command deletes the file currently opened in the editor and closes it.
This requires a double confirmation because it could be disastrous.</p>

<p>When ever you edit files using any hex editor you should <strong>always</strong>
have a backup anyway.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#import-hexdump">Importing a hexdump file</a></h2>

<p>The <dfn>File/Import from hexdump</dfn> command imports hexdump data from the clipboard or from a file.</p>

<p> The data you choose to import can be in one of two formats. One is a text 
version of the display &amp; the other is all the hex digits on one line.</p>


<p>The frhed will try to determine the type by looking for characters that are
not whitespace or hexdigits and you will be asked to verify the frhed's findings.</p>

<p>If you decide it is in the frhed display format then you will be asked if you
want the display settings found in the file to replace current ones.  If so,
frhed can determine the offset length, the number of bytes per line, if the
offset length should be automatically adjusted and possibly if the data is
ANSI/OEM from its contents.  If any of these cannot be determined their
settings will remain the same.</p>

<p>frhed will also notify you if the character and hex data do not agree with each
other or the offsets are invalid and you may choose to ignore any more of these notices.</p>

<p>If illegal characters are found in the hexdata section or the data ends unexpectedly
the operation will not be able to continue and you will have the option of keeping
the data that has already been found or cancelling the operation.</p>

<p>Also if the first offset found is not zero you can insert that amount of null bytes
at the start of the file and if you choose not to and you chose to alter relevant
display settings then frhed will display offsets relative to the first offset found.</p>

<p>If you decide it is not in the frhed display format then frhed will go through the
file filtering out whitespace and adding each hex digit found as a nibble (If odd
no's of hex digits are present then '0' will be the last nibble).
If other characters are found frhed will complain and give you the option of ignoring
the any other illegal characters that are found.</p>

<p>If the file access permissions don't allow writing or open-read-only mode is on then
read-only mode will be engaged.</p>

<p>If the current file has been changed, then you will be prompted if you want to lose
the changes, save the changes or cancel the request.</p>

<p><b>BUGS</b>:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the file was output using an offset length that is smaller than is required
the parser will determine that the character data does not match the hex data.
If the output data is edited to the same as with an offset length of 2 the same
thing happens.  This occurs because of a bug in <a href="#export-as-hexdump">File/Export as Hexdump</a>, causing it to
remove characters from the end of each line that has larger offset lengths than that
of the first line.  This bug was fixed in v1.0.156.Pabs.  If you know the file was
output using a small offset length and are sure that you have not edited it press
Yes to ignore any further mismatches, no to ignore that one or cancel to cancel the
Import operation.  Ignoring the mismatches will have no effect.</li>

</pre>

<p>On the far left are the offsets of the first byte in the line in hexadecimal notation.
You can choose the offset length or make it automatically adjusted to the length of the
largest offset with the <a href="#options-settings">Options/View Settings</a> command or right-click the offsets to
increment their lengths or left-click them to decrement their lengths (when auto-adjust is off).
Then come the actual byte values, with vertical separating lines after every fourth byte in the line.
You can choose the number of bytes to display per line with <a href="#options-settings">Options/View Settings</a>,
and also, if it should be automatically adjusted to the window width. To the far right
are the character representations of these values, with dotted lines on the left and
right of this section. You can choose the character set for these representations as
well as the font size with the <a href="#options-character-set">Options/Character set</a> command. As you can see, the
first byte of the second line of the sample hexdump has the hexadecimal value 64
and the corresponding character is a lower case "d". The position after the last
byte of the file is marked with a double underscore "__" in the byte section.</p>

<p>Blinking in the window somewhere is a rectangular caret, if the window is enabled.
If it is in the byte section, then it stands on either of the two nibbles (half-bytes).
If it is in the character section, then it stands on one character corresponding with
one byte. In either case the corresponding other representation is shown inverted in 
the other section.</p>

<p>On the bottom of the window is the status bar, which displays additional information.
In the first section of the status bar you can find the current offset of the byte
which the caret is marking in hexadecimal and decimal notation. After that come the
bits of the current byte. Also in this section, on the right side, is something like this:</p>

<pre>Unsigned: B:35,W:16931,L:1395933731</pre>

<p>These are the values of the byte (B:), the word (W:) and the longword (L:) value starting
at this offset in decimal notation. These are computed depending on the setting for signed or
unsigned values (Choose with the <a href="#options-settings">Options/View Settings</a> command) and on the binary mode setting,
either Little-endian (Intel format) or Big-endian (Motorola format).
Choose with the <a href="#options-binary-mode">Options/Binary mode</a> command.</p>

<p>In the second section of the status bar are indicators for:</p>

<ul>
<li>character set: "ANSI" or "OEM".</li>
<li>entering mode: "OVR" for overwriting or "INS" for inserting on keyboard input. If
frhed is in read-only mode, then there will be a "READ" here.</li>
<li>binary mode: "L" for Little-endian or "B" for Big-endian.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the third section the file size in bytes is displayed.</p>

<p>The status bar can also be used to toggle various parameters
and act as a shortcut to certain commands.</p>

<p>The status bar takes into account the same factors when considering
if the selected command should be carried out as the menus do when
disabling commands. If there are 2 alternatives in one place and
one is disabled then the other one will be used.</p>

<p>A single left click in the third section is a shortcut to <a href="#edit-append">Edit/Append</a>
(right is <a href="#edit-file-properties">Edit/File properties</a>) - Note that this may change in the future.</p>

<p>Clicking in the middle section will toggle the parameter clicked on
- ANSI &harr; OEM, READ &rarr; INS &rarr; OVR &rarr; READ&hellip; (right-click
 goes back other way) , L &harr; B.</p>

<p>Left or right clicking in the first section can result in many different
things depending on where you click and state of the file opened.</p>

<p>When part of the file is selected you may deselect (cursor goes to the
first nibble of the first byte of the selection or last of last for a
right click) by clicking in the space on the right or the word "Selected:"
or alter the selection using <a href="#edit-select-block">Edit/Select block</a> by clicking in the offsets region.</p>

<p>If the file is empty clicking the first part will bring up <a href="#edit-append">Edit/Append</a>.</p>

<p>If the file is not empty and the cursor is on the end byte then <dfn>Edit/Goto</dfn>
will be activated on a left click or the cursor goes to the previous byte
on a right click.</p>

<p>Otherwise (when not on the end byte, selected or empty) the click behaviour
is complex and summarised in the colour-coded table below. The right action is
omitted where it is the same as the left one.</p>

<p>If you have suggestions as to what else the status bar could/should (not) do just
drop me (<a href="mailto:pabs3@zip.to">Pabs</a>) a line.</p>

<p>The window also has a vertical and a horizontal scrollbar, which can be used to
scroll the view. They don't change the caret position.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h1><a name="#moving-in-the-file">Moving in the file</a></h1>

<p>You can move the caret with the arrow keys. Press TAB to toggle the editing mode between byte and
character editing. When there is a selection TAB brings the selection into the middle of the display.</p>

<p>You can also jump to any position by choosing the <dfn>Edit/Go To</dfn> command and entering
an offset, like "125", which will set the caret position to offset 125 decimal. For relative jumps
in the file, for example if you want to go to an offset 150 bytes after the current one, you have
to start with "+" as the first character and follow this with either a decimal number or a hex
number starting with "x". So to jump 150 bytes forward you have to enter "+150" or "+x96" in hex
notation. For backward relative jumps start with "-" (minus) as the first character.</p>

<p>To jump to the start of the line press Home or End for the end of the line.
To jump directly to the end of the file press Ctrl+End, for the beginning Ctrl+Home.</p>

<p>frhed can find text and binary values in a file. Choose <dfn>Edit/Find</dfn> to do this.
In the dialog you can choose if the case of the text parts of the find string are to be
ignored and the find direction. To encode binary values, frhed uses a special syntax. Example:</p>

<pre>Here is the findstring&lt;bd:0&gt;FloatValue&lt;fl:-14.56&gt;</pre>

<p>This will cause frhed to search for a string "Here is the findstring." followed by a
zero-byte, then the text "FloatValue" and a 4-byte float with the value -14.56.</p>

<p>Note that coded binary values will also be transformed by the "match case" option of the Find
command, so if you search for a byte with the hex value of 0x41 (this is the upper-case letter "A")
with the match-case option disabled, then frhed will also find bytes with the hex value 0x61
(the lower-case letter "a"). Therefore you should always search for discrete binary values with
case-matching enabled or you might not get correct results.
Please see <a href="#special-syntax">Using the special syntax</a> for further information.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Edit/Find next</dfn> and <dfn>Edit/Find previous</dfn> commands find the next or previous
occurance of the findstring last entered in the Find-dialog, with the match-case option enabled
or disabled as chosen in it. If there was no previous findstring the both Find next &amp; Find previous
commands will bring up the <dfn>Edit/Find</dfn> dialog.</p>

<p>By positioning the mouse cursor on a byte or a character and pressing the left mouse
button you can also set the caret position.</p>

<p>You can also move in the file by choosing one of the bookmarks in the "Bookmarks"
menu section. The caret will be set to that offset immediately.</p>

<h2><a name="#using-the-mouse">Using the mouse</a></h2>

<p>frhed implements OLE drag-drop to allow you to move data in a file,
between frhed instances and even between frhed and other applications.
It follows similar standards to most OLE apps, but when dropping and
there is more than one format you must choose which format(s) to insert
and you need to specify which format(s) to transfer before you can drag
data to other apps. To specify the formats to use and how to use them
for OLE Drag-drop choose <a href="#options-ole-dragndrop">Options/OLE Drag-drop</a>. Currently frhed can output
"BinaryData" (used for transfers between frhed instances), both types
of hexdump as CF_TEXT, the special syntax as CF_TEXT and Rich Text
Format for pasting properly formatted &amp; coloured hexdumps into
wordprocessors</p>

<p>When moving or copying data around in the file you don't have to choose which
format as frhed just does what you wanted.</p>

<p>When you drag data over frhed a flashing cursor shows where the data will
be inserted.</p>

<p>Below is a summary of the keys that can be used to control the drag
operation and their effects.</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Button</td><td>Effect</td></tr>
<tr><td>ESC</td><td>Cancel dragging operation</td></tr>
<tr><td>Left mouse</td><td>Move data</td></tr>
<tr><td>Right/middle mouse</td><td>Choose either Move or Copy from a menu/dialog on the drop</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ctrl</td><td>Copy data</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shift</td><td>Overwrite data (can be combined with both Move and Copy)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Note that the Overwrite mode of the file is ignored when dropping.
To overwrite existing data with that being dropped use the shift key.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#using-the-keyboard">Using the keyboard</a></h2>

<p>For overwriting data the overwriting entering mode must be enabled, that means,
the status bar must show "OVR" somewhere. Toggle the entering mode with the Insert-key
on the keyboard or choosing <dfn>Edit/Toggle entering mode</dfn>. You can overwrite the data in the
bytes section by moving the cursor to the appropriate position and pressing any of the
hexadecimal digits 0-9 and a-f on the keyboard. The nibble the caret is marking currently
will be set to that value and the caret will then go on to the next nibble. If the caret
is in the bytes section, pressing any alphanumeric key will set the current byte (that
wich the caret is marking) to that value, and the caret will go on to the next byte.</p>

<p>For inserting data the status bar must show "INS" somewhere. Entering data now will
insert a byte at the current position.</p>

<p>If there is a selection then you can replace it with a single character.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#edit-cut">The <dfn>Edit/Cut</dfn> command</a></h2>
<p>This command is used to remove bytes from the file. These bytes can either be
copied to the clipboard (as text with special syntax for non-character bytes)
or just deleted. In the dialog you can choose the start offset where the
cutting begins (the byte at that offset is the first to be cut), how many
bytes to cut (specify either the offset of the last byte to cut or the number
of bytes including the first byte to be cut, and check the appropriate radio
button). If the data should be cut to the clipboard, check the checkbox on the
bottom of the dialog box.</p>

<p>If the command is chosen without a selection, then the values in the dialog
will be set so that the byte at the current offset will be cut.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#edit-copy">The <dfn>Edit/Copy</dfn> command</a></h2>
<p>This command is used to copy bytes from the file to the clipboard. It is similar
to the <a href="#edit-cut">Edit/Cut</a> command, only the data will only be copied, not removed.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#edit-paste">The <dfn>Edit/Paste</dfn> command</a></h2>
<p>This either inserts or overwrites data from the clipboard starting at the current
offset. Choose a radio button for the writing mode wished for. You can also choose
how many times the current data is written and how many bytes to skip between each
write of the data.</p>

<p>If "Paste coded binary values as text" is unchecked, all data in the clipboard is
considered to contain special syntax, so &lt;ld:150&gt; will not be written as the text "&lt;ld:150&gt;"
but as a longword value of 150. Check the checkbox if you want to paste as text. The binary mode
(Little or Big-endian) and character set (ANSI or OEM) is used as set in the options.</p>

<p>You can also choose which clipboard data you want to paste.</p>

<p>If one of the text formats (CF_DSPTEXT, CF_OEMTEXT, CF_TEXT and CF_UNICODETEXT)
is chosen trailing null characters are not pasted. Also pasting CF_UNICODETEXT doesn't
work unless "Paste coded binary values as text" is checked.  This is because the
translation routine only works with single byte text.  Don't count on it but I (Pabs) may
implement a Unicode version in the future.</p>

<p>If any other format is used the full binary data is pasted.  As a consequence of the
way Windows works, however, there may be some null/garbage bytes at the end of the pasted
data.  This is because Windows allocates clipboard data in blocks (not sure what size) and
when a program creates clipboard data in a buffer that does not fit exactly in to a number
of blocks the remaining bytes are left zeroed out or filled with garbage.  This is fine
(besides being wasteful) but Windows does not provide a way to look up the requested size
of the data but only the allocated size.</p>

<p>The list will be automatically updated when the contents of the clipboard change.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#edit-paste-dialog">The <dfn>Edit/Paste with dialogue</dfn> command</a></h2>
<p>This either inserts or overwrites data starting at the current offset. Choose a radio
button for the writing mode wished for. The big edit-box is initialised with the current
text content of the clipboard. Since Edit-boxes can not hold very large amounts of data
(ca. 64K), please use Edit or Paste to paste such large blocks of memory.You can also choose
how many times the current data is written and how many bytes to skip between each
write of the data.</p>

<p>If "Paste coded binary values as text" is unchecked, all data in the edit-box is
considered to contain special syntax, so <code>&lt;ld:150&gt;</code> will not be written as the text
"&lt;ld:150&gt;" but as a longword value of 150. Check the checkbox if you want to paste
as text. The binary mode (Little or Big-endian) and character set (ANSI or OEM)
is used as set in the options.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#edit-append">The <dfn>Edit/Append</dfn> command</a></h2>
<p>This command appends a number of zero-bytes to the file.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#edit-delete">The <dfn>Edit/Delete</dfn> command</a></h2>
<p>This command calls the same dialog as the <a href="#edit-cut">Edit/Cut</a> command, only with the "cut to clipboard"
checkbox already disabled.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#edit-select-block">The <dfn>Edit/Select</dfn> block command</a></h2>

<p>With this you can explicitely choose what block of data is to be selected, by specifying
the start and end offsets of the block.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#edit-enter-decimal">The <dfn>Edit/Enter decimal value</dfn> command</a></h2>
<p>With this you can overwrite data with an integer value of either byte, word or longword size.
The start offset is initialized with the current offset, in hexadecimal notation. Note that if
you change the start offset, use hexadecimal notation and prefix with "x". You can also choose
the number of times to overwrite or insert and the size of the value. The values are initialised
with the current offset, the value of the current offset, byte size and 1 time.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#edit-manipulate-bits">The <dfn>Edit/Manipulate bits</dfn> command</a></h2>
<P>If you need to manipulate individual bits in a byte, then go to this byte with the caret and
choose the command. Check the appropriate checkboxes for the bits and select OK. The boxes are
initialised with the current value.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#edit-fill-selection">The <dfn>Edit/Fill selection with</dfn> command</a></h2>
<p>First select some of the bytes in a file then open the Fill selection with dialog from the
edit menu or using Ctrl + Shift + F. If there is no selection it is assumed that the whole file
needs to be filled.</p>

<p>Decide if you want to enter the bytes in yourself - this is usefull for small numbers
of bytes and if so select Input from the combo box and enter the bytes below it.</p>

<p>Otherwise you may want to fill the selection with a file by selecting File from the
combo box and browsing to a file (It <i>MUST</i> exist - this is why only browsing is allowed).
Note that if the selection is larger than the file or the hex string you entered the
selection will be filled with multiple copies of your string/file and if it is smaller
only a part of the string will be entered into the selection.
Note also that an odd number of hex digits will result in the first nibble of the last
byte being the last hex digit entered (This doesn't apply to files as partial bytes
cannot be present in files).</p>

<pre>e.g. "ffa" &rarr; "ff af fa &hellip;" &rarr; "ÿ¯ú &hellip;"</pre>

<p>Then select the type of assignment operator you want to use:</p>

<p>= - regular assign<br>
|= - perform a bitwise or with the current byte and then assign.<br>
&amp;= - perform a bitwise and with the current byte and then assign.<br>
^= - perform a bitwise xor with the current byte and then assign.</p>

<p>Below are some examples:</p>

<table style="text-align: center;">

<h2><a name="#edit-reverse-bytes">The <dfn>Edit/Reverse bytes</dfn> command</a></h2>
<p>This will reverse the order of some bytes around in the file.</p>

<p>You will need to specify the two ends of the block whose bytes will be reversed.</p>

<p>You can prefix an 'x' to specify hex notation.</p>

<p>The selection and caret will be moved intelligently.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#edit-move-or-copy">The <dfn>Edit/Move/Copy bytes</dfn> command</a></h2>
<p>This will move or copy some bytes around in the file.</p>

<p>You will need to specify one end of the block to be moved
or copied and either its length (negative* if the specified
end is to be the end with the larger offset, positive if is
to be the start of the block) or its other end.</p>

<p>You will also need to specify either where to position the
first (or the last) byte of the block or how many bytes
forward or backward* to move or copy the block.</p>

<p>You can prefix an 'x' to specify hex notation.</p>

<p>It is possible to copy the block to a position inside of itself.</p>

<h2><a name="#edit-compare">The <dfn>Edit/Compare from current offset</dfn> command</a></h2>
<p>If you need to compare two files then load one into frhed and choose this
command. You will first be prompted to choose the file to compare with.
Choose a file and then the OK button. Comparison will occur from the current caret offset.</p>

<p>If the chosen file matches the data in the loaded file from the current offset, you will
be prompted so. Otherwise you will get a list of areas of difference to choose from. Areas
of difference are ranges of bytes which are different in the files. For example:</p>

<pre>
File 1: 00 01 02 03 04 (loaded file)
File 2: 00 ff ff 03 04
</pre>

<p>In this case you will  get one area of difference 2 bytes in size from offset 1 to 2.
These offsets are measured relative to the current caret position. When you choose an area
of difference then it will be selected and displayed in the main window.</p>

<p>You can also copy the list of differences to the clipboard.</p>

<h2><a name="#edit-apply-template">The <dfn>Edit/Apply template</dfn> command</a></h2>
<p>Use this command to apply a binary template on the file.
A binary template consists of a text file with the extension
"tpl" that contains a number of variable type+name combinations,
such as this:</p>

<pre>
BYTE filetype
WORD version

</pre>

<p>This sample template file named "sample.tpl" is included in the frhed directory. When the command
is chosen from the menu you will be prompted to choose the template file you want to apply. frhed will
then load that file and use the code in it to give you a structured "interpretation" of the data in the
currently loaded file, starting at the current byte. The result will be displayed in the edit-box of a

<pre>
File: C:\Data\test.dat
Template file: C:\frhed\sample.tpl
Applied at offset: 15

BYTE filetype = 66 (signed) = 66 (unsigned) = 0x42 = 'B'
WORD version = 30285 (signed) = 30285 (unsigned) = 0x764d
DWORD filelength = 8 (signed) = 8 (unsigned) = 0x8

-&gt; Length of template = 7 bytes.
</pre>

<p>Following variable types are recognized: (recognition is case-sensitive, so "byte" is not recognized as type "BYTE")</p>

<ul>
<li>a byte-size value: "BYTE", "char"</li>
<li>a word-size value: "WORD", "short"</li>
<li>a longword-size value: "DWORD", "int", "long", "LONG"</li>

<h2><a name="#options-binary-mode">The <dfn>Options/Binary mode</dfn> command</a></h2>

<p>What kind of byte order to use: Either Little-endian, as used in Intel-computers or Big-endian,
used for example in computers with a Motorola processor. The difference between these modes is thus:
Consider a longword, which is 4 bytes (named A to D) long.</p>

<pre>Longword in processor register = ABCD.</pre>

<p>The least significant bit, which has the value 1, is found in byte "D". In a processor
register the longword is ordered in this way. If this value is written to a position in memory,
then by Intel convention the longword is written in this way, with the growing offsets to the right:</p>

<pre>Longword in memory = DCBA.</pre>

<p>That is, the bytes making up the longword are written in reverse order as they are found in a processor register.</p>

<p>This means that a file written by a Big-endian machine will contain wrong longword and word values
if read by a Little-endian machine without conversion.</p>

<p>Of course if you are a power user you will probably prefer to do all of the below yourself.</p>

<p>I (Pabs) am thinking of merging all/most of this into an &quot;frhed manager&quot; - email me if you think it is a good idea.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#in-all-context">In all context menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#in-unknown-context">In unknown context menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#default-in-unknown">Is default in unknown context</a></li>

<li><a href="#remove-frhed">Remove frhed</a></li>
<li><a href="#upgrade">Upgrade</a></li>
<li><a href="#shortcuts">Shortcuts to frhed</a></li>
</ul>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#in-all-context">In all context menu</a></h2>
<p>When checked this item indicates that in the context menu of all files
there appears an item named &quot;Open in frhed&quot; which will launch
frhed with the file opened.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#in-unknown-context">In unknown context menu</a></h2>
<p>The same is true of this item except that the item appears only in the
context menu of files that have an extension that has not yet been registered
with Windows.  NOTE that if both are checked both will appear on the menu
of unregistered files and that these files generally have an
&quot;Open with&hellip;&quot; command.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#default-in-unknown">Is default in unknown context</a></h2>
<p>When this item is checked the &quot;Open in frhed&quot; command for
unregistered files becomes the default action when double clicking or
pressing enter on these files in explorer.  This may not work properly
but it should.  The reason a similar option was not provided for the all
context is that then you would not be able to open your files with the
proper applications.  It is not recommended but if you wish you may do
this yourself - just set the default value in the key &quot;HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell&quot;
to &quot;Open in frhed&quot;.  This is disabled if the above option is
not checked.  Unchecking the above option unchecks and disables this one.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#save-ini">Save ini when required</a></h2>
<p>When this item is unchecked frhed will not save data to the registry
when it normally does.  It does this on exit and at other times -
see the source where the function save_ini_data is called.  This option
was added so that the <dfn>Registry/Remove frhed</dfn> item could work properly.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#change-inst">Change instance</a></h2>
<p>Allows the user to switch from one set of instance options to another
and to specify the instance number to save to on exit and at other times.
Note that if 2 or more instances of frhed are open at once the options you
save on exit may be overwritten.  If you enter a non-existent instance
number that instance will be written to the registry with current values
and current values will stay the same.  This option is always enabled so
that you may reload instance options at any time.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#remove-frhed">Remove frhed</a></h2>
<p>Removes, in this order, registered links to frhed, both context menu
entries, registry entries for the current version and registry entries
for old versions.  This option requires an initial confirmation and
confirmations for each removal operation that is required.  If the user
removes those of the links, context menu entries and or registry entries
for the current version that are present they are given instructions on
how to totally remove frhed from their computer and asked to email the
author. This option is disabled if none of the above are present. Previous
versions of frhed are ignored.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#upgrade">Upgrade</a></h2>
<p>This brings up a dialog box that can be used to upgrade frhed.</p>

<p>To help you decide which version to upgrade from you can browse the
versions &amp; instances, using the data list, MRU list, link list and the
'fake' frhed display window to find the instance you are looking for
and show you various properties of the selected instance.</p>

<p>This dialog allows the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copying instances from a version to the current version.</li>
<li>Reading the data from a selected instance into memory.</li>
<li>For reading and copying, links from the selected version are
copied over and rewritten to the disk, updating them in the process.</li>
<li>Deleting selected instances from selected versions.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you work only with the registry, however, you have much more
control over your options and by exporting the HKCU\Software\frhed key
to a &quot;.reg&quot; file, deleting the key, editing the file and
importing it back into the registry you can combine options from several
previous versions.  It is recommended that you use the upgrade dialog or
the shortcut manager (next section) to (automatically) update links after
you have manually edited the registry.</p>

<p>Note that versions of frhed before v1.0.154 used ini files and therefore
you cannot upgrade from them without manually entering their data into the
registry or converting the ini files to reg files.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="#shortcuts">Shortcuts to frhed</a></h2>
<p>This is a link manager specific to frhed.  All links to frhed created
by this have the filename &quot;frhed.lnk&quot;. You can add new links
by specifying paths to put them in, move existing links to new paths, delete
links one at a time, reload the list of links from the registry, find links
to current &amp; old versions in the file system and create links in any of four predefined places:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Desktop</li>
<li>Start menu</li>
<li>Programs menu</li>
<li>Send To menu</li>
</ol>

<p>The paths of these are read from the registry and should always point to the correct path.
The paths of the links (without names) are stored in the registry under HKCU\Software\frhed\<var>&lt;current version&gt;</var>\links.
All values in this key that contain strings are loaded into the list of links after being verified and or updated.</p>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ul>
<li>The link manager tries to keep the registry &amp; file system up to date as much as possible and if you delete a link from explorer &amp; load the link manager the all items in the registry will be recreated.</li>
<li>Duplicates are not allowed and if you delete one of the values from the registry then frhed will not be able to delete the corresponding link from the file system.</li>
<li>You cannot create links on read-only devices as the browsing mechanism detects volumes where files cannot be created.  These include places that do not have a path in the file system, like places such as Control Panel etc., places on read-only media and places on volumes that are full.</li>
<li>Renaming a link will allow you to delete it from the registry but not the file system.</li>
<li>If there are links to removable media you may see DVD/CD/floppy activity when frhed is searching for links.</li>
<li>Note that to have links to more than one version of frhed (that has the shortcut manager) you will have to create one link, rename it by appending a version no and then create the other link and rename it in the same way.  This will ensure that if you accidentally add a link to frhed to a folder then links to any old versions will not be overwritten. These links will not be safe from the find n' fix function - to make them safe rename the exe by appending a version number and create a link to the exe that is not named frhed.lnk (to prevent it being overwritten).</li>
<li>Update &amp; find n' fix both search recursively from a user specified directory for links to frhed - update looks for links to the filename of the running version of frhed while find n' fix looks for links to any frhed.exe that is in the search tree.  Duplicate links in the same directory will be removed and all links found will be renamed to frhed.lnk.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="#faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h1>
<hr>
<p>Q: How do I search for hex values?</p>
<p>A: You have to describe the values using a special syntax (as described in
"Using the special syntax" in the help file). For example the byte value 0xf7
has to be written as (you must write the angled brackets too!)

<pre>&lt;bh:f7&gt;</pre>

where the b means byte-sized value (otherwise use a "w" for word-size or "l" for longword-size)
and the h means hexadecimal notation (otherwise use "d" for decimal notation).
This notation can be combined with text after it or before it, or several encoded values after
another etc.</p>

<p>Q: frhed opens all files from Explorer supenly. How do I remove this behavior?</p>
<p>A: Uncheck the following: <dfn>Registry/In all context menu</dfn>, <dfn>Registry/Is default in unknown context</dfn>
&amp; <dfn>Registry/In unknown context menu</dfn>. Or edit the registry - Delete HKCR\*\shell\Open in frhed\,
HKCR\Unknown\shell\Open in frhed\ &amp; the "(Default)" values under their parent keys.</p>
<hr>
<p>Q: What do the B:??, W:??, L:?? in the status bar mean?</p>
<p>A: These show you the byte (B), word (W) and longword (L) value beginning at the current cursor
position, interpreted as either signed or unsigned, which is indicated in front of the "B:".</p>
<hr>
<p>Q: I know that two files I am comparing with the <dfn>Edit/Compare from current offset</dfn> command
are equal, why does frhed show me lots of differences?</p>
<p>A: As the command's name indicates, the file you choose from the following dialogue is compared
to the currently loaded file beginning from the CURRENT CURSOR POSITION. So if you want to know
if the two files match completely beginning to end, you must put the blinking cursor in the
very first position of the file, that is, at index zero. Just press Ctrl+Pos1 on the keyboard to
go there directly.</p>
<hr>
<p>Q: My Wheel Mouse does not work correctly with frhed. Are wheel mice supported?</p>
<p>A: I also use a Logitech wheel mouse, which works fine with frhed. It is possible that the standard
drivers installed by Windows for wheel mice do things slightly differently than the "real" Logitech
drivers. I suggest you install the original drivers supplied by your mouse manufacturer. If
you have any success with this, please tell me about it, I don't know if this really works.</p>

<h1><a name="#custom-styles">Custom stylesheets</a></h1>
<p>This help file uses CSS or "Cascading Style Sheets" to change the display characteristics
of text, lists, images, tables and pretty much everything else. NOTE: Stylesheets may only
work with IE4 and above.</p>

<p>All topics in this help file (even this one) reference three CSS files in the following order:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>before.css</code> is located in the same directory as this help file (frhed.chm).<br>
Use this stylesheet if you want to override browser defaults, but keep frhed's default styles.</li>
<li><code>frhed.css</code> is located inside this help file and contains the default styles for this help file.</li>
<li><code>after.css</code> is located in the same directory as this help file.<br>
Use this stylesheet if you want to override both the browser defaults and frhed's defaults.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: <code>before.css</code> and <code>after.css</code> are accessed using JavaScript, so you must
turn it on before you can use these style sheets. The alternative to using JavaScript would have been
to put them in the root directory of the disk where this help file is located and accessed them using
static links to <code>file:///before.css</code> and <code>file:///after.css</code>. The JavaScript
method, however, is much more flexible and prevents the need for write access to the root directory,
which would probably not be granted on locked down machines, such as in university computer labs and
work machines. If you prefer to use static links you can do so by installing the help file source, replacing all the
JavaScript stuff with static links, regenerating the individual topics from the big-flat-file using pydocgen.py
and recompiling using HTML Help Workshop from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>.<br>
e.g. This:</p>

<pre>&lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;document.createStyleSheet(externlink("after.css"));&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>is converted to:</p>
<pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="file:///<var>&lt;your static path&gt;</var>/after.css"&gt;</pre>
<p>Alternatively someone may already have done this - check on <a href="#contact">these websites</a>.</p>

<p>It is beyond the scope of this help file to discuss the intricacies of stylesheet syntax and usage,
but see below for a few tips. There are a number of references on the Web and here are two to get you
started:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/">WWW Consortium's CSS2 Specification</a>
- The official specification.</li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnie40/html/css-ie4.asp">Microsoft's
"Cascading Style Sheets in Internet Explorer 4.0"</a> - what is supported by HTMLHelp</li>
</ul>

<p><code><a href="frhed.css">frhed.css</a></code> is available to study and use in <code>before.css</code>
and <code>after.css</code>.<br>
Click one of the following buttons to open your CSS files in in their associated program.</p>

<form><input type="button" name="Button" value="before.css" OnClick="externlink('before.css',true);">
<input type="button" name="Button" value="after.css" OnClick="externlink('after.css',true);"></form>

<p><b>Tips</b>:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can import other stylesheets using <code>@import "mystylesheet.css";</code>. The semicolon(;) is important and the import must be before the definition of any styles.</li>
<li>You set styles using the following syntax:<br>
Note the semicolon after each value.<br>
There is more to the syntax than what is listed here - please visit the above two references.

<pre>[<var>&lt;some-tag&gt;</var>][.<var>&lt;some-class&gt;</var>][:<var>&lt;some-pseudo-class&gt;</var>] {
	(<var>&lt;some-attribute&gt;</var>: <var>&lt;some-value&gt;</var>;)...
}...</pre>

<table>
<tr><td>Variable</td><td>Explanation</td></tr>
<tr><td><var>&lt;some-tag&gt;</var></td><td>The name of a HTML tag e.g. body, a, ul.</td></tr>
<tr><td><var>&lt;some-class&gt;</var></td><td>The value of the "class" attribute in a tag in the document eg. <code>.SomeClass { color: red; }</code> (or <code>p.SomeClass</code>) in CSS then <code>&lt;p class="SomeClass"&gt;Some text&lt;/p&gt;</code> in HTML.</td></tr>
<tr><td><var>&lt;some-pseudo-class&gt;</var></td><td>The name of a supported pseudo-class like <code>hover</code>, <code>active</code>, <code>link</code> or <code>visited</code>. Two useful pseudo classes that are in the official CSS spec, but are not supported by IE, include <code>before</code> and <code>after</code>, which can insert strings before and after what ever their style is applied to.</td></tr>
<tr><td><var>&lt;some-attribute&gt;</var></td><td>A style attribute like <code>color</code> or <code>text-decoration</code>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><var>&lt;some-value&gt;</var></td><td>The value of an attribute like <code>#00ff00</code>(a bright green colour) or <code>150%</code>(a relative size).</td></tr>
</table>
</li>
<li>Comments are C-style (<code>/*Some comments*/</code>), not C++-style (<code>//Some comments</code>) and they cannot be nested.</li>
<li>To temporarily disable one of the two external style sheets just rename it or comment out its contents.</li>
<li>For changes to a stylesheet to come into effect you need to change pages or refresh the current page (press F5).</li>
<li>It can be hard to revert styles to what they were before a sheet was applied - you need to find out a reasonable default &amp; apply that.</li>
</ul>
